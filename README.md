# Goofy Chat App v2

This is the 2nd version of [goofy chat app](https://github.com/marceldobehere/goofy-chat-app).

It is essentially a secure end-to-end encrypted chat app that allows users to chat with each other in real-time.

NOTE: It is very very very WIP right now. (The UI is literally nonexistent rn lmao)

Also NOTE: This is the statically hosted client. The server can be found [here](https://github.com/marceldobehere/goofy-chat-app-v2).
